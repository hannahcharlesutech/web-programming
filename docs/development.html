        <h4>Achieve Your Goals</h4>
        <p> In this chapter, charlie learns from Micheal the wise teachings from Mr.Davis that success is not accidental.
            Micheal explains to Charlie that success is rather achieved through intentional planning. This intentional planning is 
            in the form of having clear written goals, which gives direction and purpose to life. Without goals, persons tend to drift 
            and settle for less. This chapter emphasizes the importance of setting specific, measurable, attainable and time bound goals as well
            as writing them down and reviewing them regularly.
        </p>
        <h5>Personal Alignment</h5>
        <p>This lesson connects beautifuly to both my academic and athletic life. As a track athlete, I have learned the importance
            of setting specific targets, like improving on my pbs and attaining certain qualification standards. In training I have 
            also learned to set small, measurable goals that lead up to big achievements. This same principle applies to my studies,
            by setting academic goals such as maintaining a 3.7 GPA and completing my degree on time. Writing down my goals, whether athletic or academic, helps
            me visualize success and work toward it constantly.

        <h4>The Proper Use of Time</h4>
        <p>This chapter highlights that everyone has the same twenty four hours every single day, but how it is used makes the difference.
            Successful people prioritze tasks that pushes them closer to their goals, while less successful people waste time on distractions.
            Effective time management means valuing each moment and investing it wisely. 

        </p>
        <h5>Personal Alignment</h5>
        <p>Having to balance athletics and school has taught me that time managementis everything. My days usually start 
            with early morniung training sessions, followed by classes and other training sessions in between and still having to find time to 
            complete assignments. I have learned to schedule my time carefully so that no area suffers. This chapter has reminded me to keep 
            prioritzing what matters most, preparing for upcoming meets and staying on top of my studies. Doing so ensures that i continue to
            perform well both on the track and in the classroom.

        <h4> Surround Yourself with the Best People</h4>
        <p>This chapter explains how the people that we associate with greatly influence our success.
            Our friends, mentors and teammates shape our mindset and habits. When we surround ourself with positive, motivated and 
            hardworking people, they help us grow while negative influences hold us back.
        </p>
        <h5>Personal Alignment</h5>
        <p>This principle has been very true in my track career. Training with disciplined and focused athletes pushes me to perform better 
            and stay consistent as the hold me accountable. Similiary in school, I try to build friendships with classmates who
            are ambitious and supportive so we can encourage each other academically. This chapter reminds me to keep choosing
            friends who bring out the best in me and reflect the kind of person i want to become.

            that must be contantly developed to stay successful.
        </p>
        <h5>Personal Alignment</h5>
        <p>As a student athlete, I realize that growth never really stops. In track, I am always learning
            new techniques to improve my form, endurance and performance. Similarly, in computing, technology is always evolving, so i must
