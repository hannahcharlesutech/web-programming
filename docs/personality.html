                <h5>Determined</h5>
                <p>I am someone who never gives up easily, whether it is mastering tough programming concepts or training for the upcoming track seasons.
                    My determination keeps me pushing through both academic and athletic challenges.
                </p>
                <p>In school, this means staying focused on my goals, studying hard and putting in the extra hours needed to improve. On the track, it 
                    is the same drive that pushes me to work towards shaving off second from my pbs by staying consistent even on the toughest training days.

    <h4> MY Hero</h4>

            <p>My hero is <strong>Shericka Jackson</strong>, one of Jamaica's fastest sprinters and a world champion,
                 known for her no. 2 time ever is the 200m. She has successfully transitioned from the 400m to the shorter sprints , a move that required discipline, 
                 courage, and a mindset built on constant self improvement.

        <div class="third">
            <p>I have  recently developed a close relationship with Shericka as I am now part of her training group.
                Getting to witness her hard work, focus, and determination first hand has been life changing. Seeing how seriously she
                 approaches every single session, even on her toughest days has shown me what it truly means to be dedicated to your craft.
               Her humility, encouragement, and discipline motivate me not only in track but also in my academic life. Shericka's consistency
                reminds me that success doesn't come from talent alone, it's built from effort, patience, and the will to push through challenges.
                 Training alongside her inspires me to dream bigger, stay focused, and believe that with hard work, greatness is possible.

    <h4>AI Business Idea</h4>
    <section id="AIbusiness">
        <div class="AI">
            <h4>AI Powered Fitness and Nutrition </h4>
            <p>
                The AI business idea that really caught my attention is a <strong>Personalized AI fitness and nutrition Tool. </strong>
                Basically, it's an app or program that uses AI to track workouts, diet, sleep, and recovery, then creates a custom plan just for you.
                It can even adjust things based on how you are progressing, how tired you are, or how busy your week is.
                As a student athlete, this sounds amazing to me. Balancing track training, schoolwork, and everything else can get pretty overwhelming.
                 Having this AI tool would help me:
                 <ul type="square">
                    <li>Plan meals and hydration to match my energy needs on heavy training days.</li>
                    <li>Adjust my schedule automatically when I have exams or other commitments.</li> 
                    <li>Get tips for recovery so I can stay healthy and avoid injuries.</li>   
                 </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Being able to see exactly what works for me and what doesn't
                would save so much stress and let me focus on actually performing my best, both on the track and in class. </p>
            
            <h5>Ethical Concerns + Solutions</h5>
                <p> A major issue with this idea is <strong>Privacy</strong>. The app would need to collect personal health info, and if it's
                     not handled carefully, that data could be misused. To fix this, My solution would be to make sure users know exactly
                      what data is being collected, allow them to control it, and keep everything encrypted and secure.</p>

            
            <h5>Example in Today's World</h5>
            <p>An excellent example of an app which uses AI in a similar way is called <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_blank" >myfitnesspal.</a> 
                It tracks nutrition, calories, and fitness progress while offering personalized feedback.</p>
